# Kubernetes the AWSome Way!

## Prerequisites

We have a limited time during the workshop, if attendees are not familiar with kubernetes check out the following introduction

[An Introduction to Kubernetes and EKS](https://eksworkshop.com/introduction/)

 
The full EKS Workshop aims to be quite deep and comprehensive. It can take many hours or days to complete every module. For our workshop, we are going to focus on a small selection of these modules that we feel relate more closely to an audience of devleopers.

Termporary AWS accounts will be provided during the workshop and we will leverage a hosted [Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/), so that attendees only need an internet connected web browser to participate. 

The workshop content will remain online and available at https://eksworkshop.com. Particpants can feel free to work through the complete workshop at their own pace after the event in their own AWS account. **Charges for AWS resources created in their AWS accounts will apply**

As you read through the lab instructions, you may see two sets of instructions. One for an AWS event, and one for working through the steps in your own account. **Please follow steps for an AWS event**
